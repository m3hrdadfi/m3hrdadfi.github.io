I am a doctoral researcher pursuing a PhD at Chalmers University of Technology. My research began in 2022, under the esteemed guidance of [Richard Johansson](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~richajo/index.html) and [Gabriel Skantze](https://www.kth.se/profile/skantze), and has since evolved. As a member of the [NLP@DSAI](https://dsai-nlp.github.io/members) group at Chalmers, my research not only builds upon my initial focus on [representation learning for Conversational AI](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~richajo/projects/wasp2022.html) but also aims to contribute to understanding and enhancing such models. Currently, I am studying mediation analysis, which is a direct extension of my curiosity to dissect the intricate memory behaviors of RAG models to better understand their decision-making processes.

If you're as excited as I am about how AI will revolutionize our communication and sharing of knowledge, let's collaborate!

Drop me an email `mehrdad.farahani [at] chalmers [dot] se`.
