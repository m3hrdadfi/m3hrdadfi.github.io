**Attention master's students!**

If you're passionate about Natural Language Processing (NLP) and need a supervisor to guide you through your research, you're in luck. My expertise and mentorship are currently available to individuals eager to learn more about NLP. To discuss your research ideas or present your proposal, please contact me directly at `mehrdad.farahani [at] chalmers [dot] se`.

Moreover, for those with a keen interest in the niche domain of Conversational Representation Learning, there's a world of possibilities awaiting you. I am particularly enthusiastic about this area and have a myriad of topics and questions that need exploration. Whether you already have a topic in mind or need some inspiration, do not hesitate to get in touch. Together, we can embark on a fulfilling academic adventure and contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving field of NLP.
