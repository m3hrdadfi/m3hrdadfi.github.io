**Attention master's students!** 

If you're passionate about Natural Language Processing (NLP) and need a supervisor to guide you through your research, you're in luck. My expertise and mentorship are currently available to individuals eager to learn more about NLP.

Moreover, for those with a keen interest in the niche domain of Conversational Representation Learning, there's a world of possibilities awaiting you. I am particularly enthusiastic about this area and have a myriad of topics and questions that need exploration. Whether you already have a topic in mind or need some inspiration, do not hesitate to get in touch. Together, we can embark on a fulfilling academic adventure and contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving field of NLP.
